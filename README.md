# PINN
This repository contains my PyTorch implementation of Physics informed neural network (PINN) from the paper "Raissi, Maziar, Paris Perdikaris, and George E. Karniadakis. "**Physics-informed neural networks: A deep learning framework for solving forward and inverse problems involving nonlinear partial differential equations.**" Journal of Computational Physics 378 (2019): 686-707." 

As an example, I solved the 1D heat partial differential equation.
