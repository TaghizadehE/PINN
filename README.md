# Simple PyTorch Implementation of Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN)

This repository contains my simple and clear to understand implementation of the paper [1]. As an example, I solved the 1D heat partial differential equation.

All the steps are included in a single file: `solve_PDE_NN.ipynb` which depends on the `pytorch` and `numpy` packages.
